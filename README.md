# GlobalX.Hypermedia.AspNetCore

GlobalX.Hypermedia.AspNetCore transforms your plain old JSON objects into hypermedia aware response. Currently the only
Using the implemented standard is the [HAL Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-00).

The library inspects the Accept header on requests. If set to `application/json+hal` it will transform the object into
a HAL compliant response accoording to the definitions you provide.

## Installation

Use nuget to pull [Globalx.Hypermedia.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Globalx.Hypermedia.AspNetCore/) into 
your project.

The add the `HalOutputFormatter` to the set of OutputFormatters to your `AddMvc` declaration.

```c#
public IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc(o =>
    {
        o.OutputFormatters.Insert(0, new HalOutputFormatter());   
    }
} 
```

## Usage

To configure your responses create a `HalConfiguration`. For example for a response class;

```c#
public class Recipe {
    public string Name {get; set;}
    public List<string> Ingredients {get; set;}
}
```



```c#
HalConfiguration ConfigureHal()
{
    HalConfiguration hal = new HalConfiguration();
    hal.For<Recipe>()
        .Links(x => new Link("self", "/recipes/{name}"))
        .Links(x => new Link("purchaseIngredients", "/recipes/{name}/purchase"))
    return hal;
}
```

This HalConfiguration is then introduced into the DI system.

```c#
services.AddSingleton<IProvideHalTypeConfiguration>(ConfigureHal());
```

If the accept header is `application/json` then the response will be;

```json
{
  "name": "egg on toast",
  "ingredients": [
    "egg",
    "toast"
  ]
}

```

If the accept header is `application/json+hal` or `application/hal+json` then the response will be;


```json
{
  "name": "egg on toast",
  "ingredients": [
    "egg",
    "toast"
  ],
  "_links": {
    "self": {
        "href": "/recipes/egg+on+toast",
        "templated": false
    },
    "purchaseIngredients": {
        "href": "/recipes/egg+on+toast/purchase",
        "templated": false
    }
  }
}

```

## Publishing

```bash
dotnet pack --include-source --include-symbols -o ./nuget

```
